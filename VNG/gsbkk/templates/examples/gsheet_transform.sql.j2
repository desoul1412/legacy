{# Google Sheet Column Transformation Example
   
   IMPORTANT: Column names with spaces must be escaped with backticks (`)
   Column names are case-sensitive
   
   Example Google Sheet columns:
   - Game
   - Product Group
   - Gross Rev - Annual KPI
   - Profit - Annual KPI
   - MAU - Annual KPI
   - Gross Rev - RFC
#}

SELECT
    `Game`,
    `Product Group`,
    `Market`,
    `Team`,
    `Month`,
    `Genre`,
    `Gross Rev - Annual KPI` as gross_rev_annual,
    `Profit - Annual KPI` as profit_annual,
    `MAU - Annual KPI` as mau_annual,
    `Gross Rev - RFC` as gross_rev_rfc,
    `Profit - RFC` as profit_rfc,
    `MAU - RFC` as mau_rfc,
    `Gross Rev - Actual` as gross_rev_actual,
    `Profit - Actual` as profit_actual,
    `MAU - Actual` as mau_actual,
    `MPU - RFC` as mpu_rfc,
    `MPU - Actual` as mpu_actual
FROM monthly_rfc_2026
ORDER BY `Month` DESC

{# 
NOTES:
1. Use backticks (`) for column names with spaces: `Gross Rev - Annual KPI`
2. Column names are case-sensitive: `Game` is different from `game`
3. Use AS to rename columns to PostgreSQL-friendly names (lowercase, no spaces)
4. Can add WHERE clauses, JOINs, etc. as needed
